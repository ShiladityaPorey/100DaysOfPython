print("Hello friends!")

print(f"Hello friends!")


INPUT = int(input("Enter an integer number: "))
#f-strings are generally used for formatting output rather than input prompts.
#For input prompts, you don't need to use f-strings.
#If you still want to include a variable within an f-string
#here's how you can do it:
INPUT= int(input(f"Enter an integer number: "))


Name='Vikram'
age=35

print(Name + "\'s age is ",age)
print(f"{Name}'s age is {age}.")



print("sum of 50+60+70 is", 50+60+70)
print(f"sum of 50+60+70 is {50+60+70}")



print("Let me tell you a story.\n")
print(f"Let me tell you a story.\n")
